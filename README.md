## Brief
Project assignment for Data Analytics Bootcamp.

We were asked to come up with a data analytics report using the skills we had acquired in the class thus far. This included the use of Excel and programming languages: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib through Jupyter Notebook.
## File Organization
For this project, the folders are made to separate the work of each individual since we all took on a separate dataset to parse. Included in each folder are:
+ Our datasets we pulled from
+ Notebook files
+ Resulting charts as image files in their own designated folders
## Members
+ Tamara Cronin
+ Angelica Ramos | Group Leader
+ Cristina Shary

# The How (not to be confused with popular British band, The Who)
## Finding a Topic
In terms of choosing a project topic we could all be invested and passionate about, I initially came to the table with a list of topics I already knew I was interested in. Among these topics were 'gentrification' and 'food'. We started with the idea of using our code to find value counts of the different types of cusine using Yelp's API in a place where gentrification is already a known issue, thus landing on San Francisco being our area of interest.

Ultimately, the consensus among our group as we started to delve into research, was that the scope of our project was too big and that the datasets we could find did not have information of ceratin stores in a given location *over time*; this would be a crucial piece of information which we had no access to.

Tammy's prior experience with the topic of low-income affecting accessibility to foods was what dove to move towards our project shift. Because of the already existing research on this topic, we were much more well-equipped, well-infromed, and had more direction in terms of what we might be able to expect as results from our data.
## Dividing the Work
As we searched for relevant datasets online, we broke the project up into three distinct parts so we could work independently from one another if needed. These sub-goals we had were as follows:
1. Analyzing the income data of San Francisco and pinpoint the highs and lows
2. Quantifying fresh food sources in the income areas that we analyze
3. Comparing our findings to the state and national findings

Cristina, me, and Tammy respectively took on each portion of the project with the hopes to come together with our sets at the end.
## Prevalent Complications
A lot of the issues we ran into had to do with our over-ambition as a group. We ideally would have wanted to include heatmaps and plot the density of foodstores in the San Francisco area, but because of the limitations of Gmaps and Matplotlibs and our being new to coding in general gave us a hard time makign those results a reality.

One of the other items that we had to dwell on was definitions. In order to really be clear with what our results really meant and how significant they were, we needed to clearly delineate what terms we were using. The way we found our definitions was by basing them off of official documentation like that of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the articles wher they show [how to understand food deserts.](https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2011/december/data-feature-mapping-food-deserts-in-the-us/)

Otherwise, we found that many of our datasets didn't need to much cleaning outside of type changes, reordering, and renaming.
## Results
By the end of this project, we unfortunately didn't do as much dataset merging as we had hoped, but I believe that we came to some important and interesting conclusions even with just camparing the results of each our members' work.
